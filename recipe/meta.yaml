#
# Changes from conda-forge recipe:
#
#  - Disable non-linux builds.
#
#  - Explicitly enable C++11 on old compilers.
#
#  - Explicitly compile with IPP.
#
#  - Compile with TBB.
#
#  - Compile against libjpeg-turbo static.
#
#  - Expose thread_count in opencv video capture.
#    Can be set with an envvar and queried via property.
#
#  - Disable GStreamer.
#    Otherwise it gets also linked to it, as it is
#    pulled by QT. We might actually want to use
#    this, but it is better to make sure ffmpeg
#    is the only video backend.
#
#  - Prepared to build against MKL.
#    But disabled (commented out mkl deps here + -DWITH_LAPACK=OFF)
#    I do not think BLAS/LAPACK are really used much out of
#    the DNN module, and last opencv release notes do claim
#    it does not make much difference anymore. If need to
#    bring back, use MKL or OpenBLAS, but do not request
#    the openblas feature.
#
#  - Put libs in /lib, not /lib64.
#
#  - Made many configuration parameters explicit in build.sh.
#    e.g. possible optimizations like CPU instruction support
#    or fast math, help for debugging etc.
#
#  - Better tests for video (seeking) and jpeg processing.
#
#  - List build information and linkages after success.
#
# There are interesting notes and links in my dear building diary.
